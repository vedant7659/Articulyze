Articulyze (Hackathon Project)



Articulyze: Speak smarter with AI-powered feedback.
Articulyze is a magical platform designed to turn your speech videos into insightful feedback through advanced AI models. Whether you're preparing for a job interview, perfecting your public speaking skills, or mastering your first date conversations, Articulyze analyses your speech, facial expressions, and engagement levels to offer valuable, personalised feedback.

Using a combination of digital image processing, natural language processing (NLP), and audio signal processing, Articulyze evaluates your communication on three key dimensions: visual cues (like facial expressions and eye contact), auditory features (such as speech fluency), and textual analysis (for logical coherence and engagement). By combining these analyses through a late-fusion multimodal approach, Articulyze provides an integrated understanding of your speaking style and areas for improvement.

This approach, detailed in D'Mello 2015, allows us to process each modality independently before combining them to generate actionable feedback; the final result is a comprehensive evaluation of your communication skills, helping you feel more confident and prepared for any speaking situation.

Features
🎥 Video Feed Analysis – Evaluate user engagement through eye contact and facial expressions

👀 Eye Contact Detection – Improve users' engagement in conversations and speeches using GazeTracking's method

😀 Facial Expression Analysis – Identifies emotions and microexpressions by using techniques from Edlitera

🎙️ Audio Feed Analysis – Focuses on fluency features in speech.

🗣 Fluency Metrics – Implements techniques from Eusipco 2023

📊 Dataset Utilisation – Uses the Avalinguo-Audio-Set

🔎 Speech Features Extracted:

⏱ Words per Minute

📖 Lexical Density (Token Type Ratio)

🔕 Zero Crossing Rate (silent pauses)

🎵 MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)

The features are extracted, trained on an extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model Chen 2016 to predict the fluency

The XGB model is trained using Randomised CV model selection, achieving 93% overall F1-Score

Alongside other features, fluency is also used as a feedback to the user

📝 Communication Transcript Analysis – Examines speech patterns, coherence, and engagement.

✍️ Tonality Analysis – Utilises tone analysis dataset + 3gpp-embedding-model-v0 + MLP

🚫 Filler Word Frequency – Computes corpus occurrence in the speech's transcript

📚 Vocabulary Sophistication – Assesses Type Token Ratio (TTR) to see how much the words are repeated

🔄 Logical Flow Detection – Leverages roberta-large_overall-coherence to use logistic regression in finding the coherence of the speech

🎭 Engagement Prediction – Uses Flesch-Kincaid Readability to estimate listener interests

Implementation
Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Next.js

Backend: Flask, Python

AI & CV & NLP & Signal: SVM, NLTK, re, Librosa, Torch, Neuphonic

Integrations: NPM

What’s Next for Articulyze?
